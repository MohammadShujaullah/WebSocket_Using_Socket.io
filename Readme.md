This website is a real-time multi-user chat application built using Node.js, Express, and Socket.IO. When a user opens the site, they enter a nickname and instantly connect to the server through a persistent WebSocket connection. The server keeps track of connected users, notifies others when someone joins or leaves, and maintains an updated online users list.

Users can send messages from the browser, which are first sent to the server and then broadcast to all connected clients with the sender’s nickname attached. As a result, every connected browser updates live without refreshing the page, providing real-time communication along with join/leave notifications and a live chat feed.
